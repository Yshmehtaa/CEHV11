## Cryptography
Things to do in crypto 
• Calc one way Hash using hashcalc 
• Perform file and text message encryption using cryptforge  (performed in VM) 
• Encrypt and decrypt data using BCTextencoder
• create and use Self-signed certificates 
• Perform disk encryption using veracrypt  (performed in VM )

• Calc one way Hash using hashcalc
So this is how you calc or see if the file is been tempared or not by seeing the digital signatures 
 

• Encrypt and decrypt data using BCTextencoder
  
got the encrypted msg now decrypt it 
password- qwerty@1234 




• Create and use Self-signed certificates 
Go to search bar in windows type IIS [ Internet information servie] 
select server  certificates 
on Action select create self-signed certificates
