### IP
For Finding the IP addresss  ( IP's - layer 3 routing )
 
linux - ifconfig 
inet - ipv4 address (decimal donation)
inet6- ipv6 address (hexadecimal donation)

ipv4 - 192.168.1.101 
192- consist of 8 digits of 0 & 1  and so on all other octate so this is 32 bit address or 4 bytes 
11111111.00000000.11111111.00000000 - 32 bits or 4bytes of address  

to resolve this we are using the NAT (network address transcalation) to ignore the ipv6
