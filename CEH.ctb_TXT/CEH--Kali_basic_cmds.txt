Installing & updating the tools    
apt update && apt upgrade 
apt install python-pip 

To fix the kali for all the (cyber mantor recommandations) versions and tools is install the pimpmykali
it's a good practise to install all the tools in /opt  folder so 
cd /opt 
git clone “the link”
./pimpmykali.sh - to run the file 

The text editor (cyber mentor use is gedit) I'm going to use nano
